Modules
-------
* mfnb.date 
    This module contains classes and functions related to time data. It
    uses fuzzy regular expressions from the third-party package regex to
    find dates within OCR extracted text and the dateparser package to 
    interpret the diversity of date formats. The Date and DateRange
    classes allow for storing dates with various precision levels, 
    reflecting the data status collected among labels.

* mfnb.geo
   This module contains classes and functions related to geocoding. It 
   uses the geopy package to search locations in 
   http://www.geonames.org. 
   
* mfnb.labeldata
    This module contains classes and functions to handle and integrate
    information extracted from specimen labels. It allows for the building of 
    searchable text databases using token extraction and text feature 
    scoring. This module uses the packages regex, sklearn, nltk, and
    leven.
    
* mfnb.name
    This module contains classes and functions designed to store people's
    names or entity information, as well as matching abbreviated text
    with full text. It uses the packages nltk and regex.

* mfnb.utils
    This module gathers generic functions for text data handling, 
    manipulation and formatting.

Dataset preparation
-------------------

**Transcripts**

These are raw transcripts of collecting event labels. They are stored in a JSON file containing a list of dictionary objects, each one having two keys:

* “ID”, a string used as a unique identifier for the transcript.
* "text”, the transcribed text.

Example:  

::

    [
        {
            "ID": "coll.mfn-berlin.de_u_c2ebe3",
            "text": "Abessinien Dire Daoua 3.-6.1936 Uhlenhuth"
        }, …
    ]

You can convert a dataset in tabular format, for instance, a TSV file with two columns containing respectively the ID and the text of each transcript, into this JSON format using the script make_labels.py.

**Collecting Events**

These are individual collecting events, a unique combination of a location, a date, and collectors’ names. They are stored in a JSON file containing a list of dictionary objects, each one having five keys:

* “ID”, a unique identifier for the collecting event.
* “location”, an address and/or a longitude/latitude coordinate
* “date”, a date
* “collector”, one or more collector names, or a responsible entity (for instance, the name of an expedition)
* “text”, a representative transcript from which this information was collected.

Example:

::

    [
        {
            "ID": "BeesNbytes00001",
            "location": "Argentina, Buenos Aires",
            "date": "15.12.1905",
            "collector": "Frank",
            "text": "Argentina Buen. Aires 15. 12. 05 Frank”
        }, …
    ]

You can convert a dataset in tabular format, for instance, a TSV file containing each of these different fields, into this JSON format using the script make_collecting_event.py.

**Collectors**

These are people or collecting entities. They are stored in a JSON file containing a list of dictionary objects with the following keys:

* “ID”, a unique identifier for the collecting event.
* “name”, the surname of the collector or the name of the entity.
* “firstname”, for humans, the first name of the collectors.
* “metadata”, a dictionary object with other information attached to the person.

Example:

::
    
    [
        {
            "ID": "collector00001",
            "name": "Walz",
            "firstname": "A J",
            "metadata": {
                "entity_type": "person"
            }
        }, …
    ]

Example of usage
----------------

**Problem:** You dispose of a set of collecting event label transcripts (transcripts.json) on the one side and have already identified a few collecting events corresponding to this collection (col_ev.json). You want to attribute the new labels to the existing collecting events and identify the labels for which a new collecting event must be written. 

**Step 1)** Cluster transcripts by similarity to regroup labels about the same collecting events. At the same time, parse the transcripts to identify collecting event information:

    `sort_labels.py -d -c collectors.json -g transcripts.json >sorted_transcripts.txt`

* Option `-d` will activate date string parsing and add two output fields with the identified verbatim and the interpreted collecting event date.
* Option `-c` collectors.json will search names of collectors or collecting entities from the database collectors.json in the transcripts and add two output fields with the identified verbatim and the interpreted collector names.
* Option `-g` will try to guess the collecting event location from the remaining text by searching the terms in the GeoNames database via the online API. Beware that the current default setting uses a free account (login: joel.tuberosa), which is limited to 1000 requests per day. If transcripts within the groups are mostly identical, you can use the option `-v pick`, which will select a representative transcript from each group, on which parsing will be performed.

Parsing is optional here; it is only meant to help later in collecting event determination.

**Step 2)** Identify the closest collecting event for each transcript using full-text search on the representative transcript attached to each collecting event.

    `match_collecting_events.py -d -p col_ev.json transcripts.json >matched_col_ev.txt`

* Option `-d` will activate date string parsing, and for each transcript where a date was identified, limit the search to collecting events with an overlapping date.
* Option `-p` will allow transcripts with an identified date but no matching collecting event in that date range to be searched against the rest of the collecting events anyway. This allows to have a matching score anyway for later evaluation, and sometimes also allows to save some matches when the date parsing is faulty.

This will return a table showing input transcripts along with matching collecting events and a hit score that represents the hit accuracy. This score takes a value between 0 and 1, with a higher value indicating higher accuracy.

**Step 3)**	Evaluate the correspondence between identified transcript clusters and existing collecting events. This is done by computing a confidence score for each cluster, representing how much the cluster corresponds to the most frequently matched collecting event among its transcripts. This confidence score is calculated as a product of the frequency of the most matched collecting events and their average hit score.

    `checkout_collecting_events.py sorted_transcripts.txt matched_col_ev.txt >checkout.txt`

With the output of this program, you should be able to identify clear correspondences between transcript clusters and the collecting event. For example, if you spot a cluster of 20 transcripts that correspond to a given collecting event with a confidence score close to 1, you can trustfully annotate the corresponding labels as about that collecting event. On the contrary, if these 20 transcripts are assigned to a given collecting event with a lower confidence score, it would be worth to go back to individual transcripts best matches to figure out whether they all pertain to the same collecting event or not, and whether you need to create a new collecting event for any of them. Finally, this program also gives you the collecting events that were not matched with any transcripts, and inversely.

**Refinement:** The above example would work well with a set of faithful transcripts and with easily differentiable transcript groups. In other cases, you could face the following issues:

**Case 1)** Transcripts' typographic errors or misinterpreted text make the whole dataset noisy. The default full-text search scoring method relies on near-exact token matches and can be too stringent. Depending on your clustering results, you can alternatively run the following command, which relies on Levenshtein distances to aggregate similar labels together.

    `sort_labels.py -d -c collectors.json -g transcripts.json -s 0.3 -r >sorted_transcripts.txt`

* Option `-s 0.3` lowers the similarity threshold for aggregation (default is 0.8).
* Option `-r` orders to compute pairwise Levenshtein distances within the aggregated group and to attempt to find a subcluster using a K-medoid clustering approach.

In addition, if parsing is impaired by transcription errors, you try the option `-v alignment` to align the transcripts and generate a character frequency-based consensus transcript on which data will be parsed.

    `match_collecting_events.py -d -p col_ev.json transcripts.json -s l >matched_col_ev.txt`

* Option `-s l` indicates to use Levenshtein distance instead of token-based scoring to find the best hits.

**Case 2)** Very similar transcripts, that just differ from a single number (for instance, a different day), that could nevertheless be very relevant, could be seen as more similar than they are with the default search method. To overcome this, the above method, using Levenshtein distance, could be a solution. If the transcripts are faithful enough, you could also try a different aggregation method, based on the parsed information, using the following command.

    `sort_labels.py -d -c collectors.json -g transcripts.json -p >sorted_transcripts.txt`

* Option `-p` orders to parse the required information (here: dates, collectors, and locations) and aggregate labels that contain the same information.
